      <p>
        There is/was a Saturday morning TV show on CBS called, &quot;Lucky
        Dog&quot;. The host and star was a guy named Brandon McMillan. At the
        beginning of the show, he would rescue a dog from a local shelter. And
        then, we&apos;d meet the eventual recipient of that dog. And through the
        show, we see Brandon training the dog specially for that person. Each
        episode ends with Brandon presenting them with the dog. I want to do a
        similar show but kinda backwards. There are ZERO tools for teaching
        people how to grieve in a healthy way. Not just for pets, but for the
        loss of a person, too. Nothing. When we experience that loss, most
        people are left at a standstill. Others around us might help, but
        actually going through the grieving process is a solo experience we are
        never prepared for and rarely have any tools. It&apos;s worse for kids.
        As adults, we have likely been to a funeral. We have had a family member
        pass and we learn from our surviving family members how to get through
        that. But when a pet dies, often even the adults have no answers about
        the grieving process. If the adults Don&apos;t know what to do, how will
        they teach their kids? This TV show gets the sad ending out of the way
        first. We see a few minutes of a person who has lost a pet and we get
        their story. The rest of the show is about what they did to heal. Each
        episode ends with them rescuing a new pet. So many people I&apos;ve
        talked to said they would never get another pet because they didn&apos;t
        want to hurt like this again. Meanwhile, there are countless pets in
        shelters who need a loving person to bring them home. It hurts so much
        because we have tremendous love. It hurts double when we withhold that
        love from another pet that needs us. What if this is teachable? Could we
        coordinate with therapists and those who work in veterinary social work
        to write a show that teaches &quot;How To Grieve&quot;? The show is
        about grieving the loss of a pet, but the lessons are easily
        transferrable to losing a person or other great losses people
        experience. The show could center around one of our locations and even
        film there. Each episode features a different way someone got through
        it.
