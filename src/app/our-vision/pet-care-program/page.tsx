      <p>
        With broken hearts, we offer compassion and grace to pets and pet owners
        we'll probably never meet.
      </p>
      <p>
        {" "}
        Economic euthanasia is a reality. The cost of the required care exceeds
        what the pet owner can afford. To keep the pet from suffering, the pet
        is euthanized. What if there was an option?
      </p>
      <p>
        {" "}
        A portion of all sales will be added to this program. Any vet can call
        and request funding for surgery or medical procedures to avoid economic
        euthanasia. This is not a loan to the pet owner. It is given freely
        based on funds available on a first come, first served basis.
      </p>
      <p>
        {" "}
        People can contribute to this fund and even earmark it for their
        favorite vet.
      </p>
      <p>
        {" "}
        It's possible that once this fund is up and running that we can
        coordinate with other organizations that assist with vet bills. The more
        BEloved grows, and spreads nationwide, the more vets that will have
        access to this fund.
      </p>
      <p>
        {" "}
        Eventually, I'd like this program to offer a pre-paid medical plan that
        includes financing and guaranteed payment to vets at pre-negotiated
        rates.
