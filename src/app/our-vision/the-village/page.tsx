      <p>
        If you've ever been to an animal shelter, you have seen first hand what
        a horrible place it is. No offense, they do the best they can with the
        money that is donated. Caring for the animals is a chore. The conditions
        are less than ideal. Cages. No wonder pets adopted there might have
        medical or behavioral issues. As best as the caregivers can do, there's
        a lot to be desired. I have a better idea.
      </p>
      <p>Instead of a shelter, let's build a village.</p>
      <p>
        Yes, I know. This is a dream and would take so much to build it. But,
        there's no harm in sharing the dream, is there? Maybe someone can help
        me realize it.
      </p>
      <p>
        First, imagine 1,000 apartments. Nice apartments!! Spacious and well
        designed. State of the art appliances. Everything luxurious. Arranged
        into a village setting that encourages neighbors to get to know their
        neighbors and work as a village.
      </p>
      <p>I'm going to give those apartments away for free.</p>
      <p>
        WHAT?!?! That's crazy!! In exchange for the really nice free apartment,
        the resident has to foster 1-2 dogs. They have to feed them, take them
        to the groomer and vet. Walk them, clean up after them, TRAIN them.
        Prepare them for a forever home in every way. There's marketing
        involved. Keep photos and videos on our social media and website. Then,
        they have to make those pets available to potential adopters and prepare
        for another foster pet.
      </p>
      <p>
        We save labor and provide an infinitely better living environment for
        the animals. Plus, a foster parent is going to catch medical issues and
        can get those addressed right away. Training issues can be addressed
        immediately. We are truly making a pet "home ready" for that potential
        adopter.
      </p>
      <p>
        The foster parent pays for their food. We require the dogs are fed high
        quality food available in our pet store. We will have leashes and toys
        and treats - on campus - for them to choose from. It's conceivable to
        rebrand/repackage a high end food with our name on it. We could possibly
        make that food available to vets and pet stores in the area. Best case
        scenario, people from outside the village are buying our food, too.
      </p>
      <p>
        The village has a groomer and each pet is required to stay up on their
        hygiene. The foster parent pays for grooming. With 1,000 apartments, an
        average of $100 per pet, approximately once a month, that'a a revenue
        stream of $100K per month.
      </p>
      <p>
        Training is important. Each pet has to visit the trainer once a month.
        Even after basics are well trained, the maintenance never ends. We don't
        have to make it a boot camp. But, staying well trained ensures that the
        pet gets the best suitors. That's a revenue stream of another $100K per
        month.
      </p>
      <p>
        All vet bills are covered by the village. However, the foster parent
        still needs to keep an eye out for medical issues so they can be
        addressed sooner rather than later. The foster parent is responsible for
        flea meds and heartworm meds since those are care, not a medical issue.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our vet clinic will need to be huge. And, I'd love it if our clinic
        became THE clinic for pets outside the village. The challenge will be
        how to build such a clinic without it becoming a competitor for other
        vets in the area. Ideally, this clinic would partner with them. Maybe it
        could fill in gaps or provide medical procedures on a "wholesale" basis.
        Surgery, for example. Maybe MRI services. An in-house pharmacy that
        competes with online sources. Communication is essential. Build
        relationships and find our niche.
      </p>
      <p>
        A proper village needs a restaurant or two and a bar or two. We need
        social events for the villagers. We need a convenience store. We need as
        many essential things to keep the village as self contained as possible.
        Could we have our own auto repair shop or oil change shop? A tire shop?
      </p>
      <p>
        Our villagers are not paying rent or utilities, but all the things they
        were spending money on beyond that, are now revenue streams for the
        village.
      </p>
      <p>
        AND, the animals are better cared for and they are home ready when a
        potential adopter gets there.
      </p>
      <p>
        We could charge a little more for our pets because they are the best. We
        could set it up that the pets all have vet prepaid medical through our
        own clinic. We could encourage them to visit our trainer and buy our
        food, join us in social events and eat at our restaurant.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'd like to at least consider the possibility of 3D printing the
        construction of the village. I think this will give us a better
        building(s) and will be less expensive. I'd like to weigh the
        possibility of solar power to save money. Maybe even a gray water system
        if that's possible. I think if we explore technology, we're going to
        find ways to improve the bottom line.
      </p>
      <p>
        Yes. I'm going to give away the apartments. I think we'll be fine,
        though.
