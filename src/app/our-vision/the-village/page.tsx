            If you&apos;ve ever been to an animal shelter, you have seen first
            hand what a horrible place it is. No offense, they do the best they
            can with the money that is donated. Caring for the animals is a{" "}
            <span className="font-bold text-primary">chore</span>. The
            conditions are less than ideal. Cages. No wonder pets adopted there
            might have <span className="font-bold text-primary">medical</span>{" "}
            or <span className="font-bold text-primary">behavioral issues</span>
            . As best as the caregivers can do, there&apos;s a lot to be
            desired. I have a{" "}
            <span className="font-bold text-primary">better idea</span>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Instead of a shelter, let&apos;s build a{" "}
            <span className="font-bold text-primary">village</span>.
          </p>
          <hr className="border-t-2 border-gray-300 my-8 w-full" />
          <p>
            Yes, I know. This is a{" "}
            <span className="font-bold text-primary">dream</span> and would take
            so much to build it. But, there&apos;s no harm in sharing the dream,
            is there? Maybe someone can help me{" "}
            <span className="font-bold text-primary">realize it</span>.
          </p>
          <p>
            First, imagine 1,000{" "}
            <span className="font-bold text-primary">apartments</span>. Nice
            apartments!! Spacious and well designed. State of the art
            appliances. Everything{" "}
            <span className="font-bold text-primary">luxurious</span>. Arranged
            into a village setting that encourages neighbors to get to know
            their neighbors and work as a{" "}
            <span className="font-bold text-primary">village</span>.
          </p>
          <p>
            I&apos;m going to give those apartments away for{" "}
            <span className="font-bold text-primary">free</span>.
          </p>
          <hr className="border-t-2 border-gray-300 my-8 w-full" />

          <p>
            WHAT?!?! That&apos;s crazy!! In exchange for the really nice free
            apartment, the resident has to{" "}
            <span className="font-bold text-primary">foster</span> 1-2 dogs.
            They have to feed them, take them to the groomer and vet. Walk them,
            clean up after them,{" "}
            <span className="font-bold text-primary">TRAIN them</span>. Prepare
            them for a{" "}
            <span className="font-bold text-primary">forever home</span> in
            every way. There&apos;s marketing involved. Keep photos and videos
            on our social media and website. Then, they have to make those pets
            available to potential adopters and prepare for another foster pet.
          </p>
          <p>
            We save labor and provide an{" "}
            <span className="font-bold text-primary">
              infinitely better living environment
            </span>{" "}
            for the animals. Plus, a foster parent is going to catch{" "}
            <span className="font-bold text-primary">medical issues</span> and
            can get those addressed right away.
            <span className="font-bold text-primary">Training issues</span> can
            be addressed immediately. We are truly making a pet{" "}
            <span className="font-bold text-primary">home ready</span> for that
            potential adopter.
          </p>
          <p>
            The foster parent pays for their food. We require the dogs are fed{" "}
            <span className="font-bold text-primary">high quality food</span>{" "}
            available in our pet store. We will have leashes and toys and treats
            - on campus - for them to choose from. It&apos;s conceivable to{" "}
            <span className="font-bold text-primary">rebrand/repackage</span> a
            high-end food with our name on it. We could possibly make that food
            available to vets and pet stores in the area. Best case scenario,
            people from outside the village are buying our food, too.
          </p>
          <hr className="border-t-2 border-gray-300 my-8 w-full" />
          <p>
            The village has a groomer and each pet is required to stay up on
            their hygiene. The foster parent pays for grooming. With 1,000
            apartments, an average of $100 per pet, approximately once a month,
            that&apos;s a revenue stream of{" "}
            <span className="font-bold text-primary">$100K per month.</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <span className="font-bold text-primary">Training</span> is
            important. Each pet has to visit the trainer once a month. Even
            after basics are well trained, the maintenance never ends. We
            don&apos;t have to make it a boot camp. But, staying{" "}
            <span className="font-bold text-primary">well trained</span> ensures
            that the pet gets the best suitors. That&apos;s a revenue stream of
            another $100K per month.
          </p>
          <p>
            All <span className="font-bold text-primary">vet bills</span> are
            covered by the village. However, the foster parent still needs to
            keep an eye out for medical issues so they can be addressed sooner
            rather than later. The foster parent is responsible for{" "}
            <span className="font-bold text-primary">flea meds</span> and{" "}
            <span className="font-bold text-primary">heartworm meds</span> since
            those are care, not a medical issue.
          </p>
          <hr className="border-t-2 border-gray-300 my-8 w-full" />
          <p>
            Our <span className="font-bold text-primary">vet clinic</span> will
            need to be huge. And, I&apos;d love it if our clinic became THE
            clinic for pets outside the village. The challenge will be how to
            build such a clinic without it becoming a competitor for other vets
            in the area. Ideally, this clinic would partner with them. Maybe it
            could fill in gaps or provide medical procedures on a{" "}
            <span className="font-bold text-primary">wholesale basis</span>.
            Surgery, for example. Maybe{" "}
            <span className="font-bold text-primary">MRI services</span>. An
            in-house pharmacy that competes with online sources.{" "}
            <span className="font-bold text-primary">Communication</span> is
            essential. Build relationships and find our{" "}
            <span className="font-bold text-primary">niche</span>.
          </p>
          <p>
            A proper village needs a{" "}
            <span className="font-bold text-primary">restaurant</span> or two
            and a <span className="font-bold text-primary">bar</span> or two. We
            need <span className="font-bold text-primary">social events</span>{" "}
            for the villagers. We need a convenience store. We need as many
            essential things to keep the village as{" "}
            <span className="font-bold text-primary">self-contained</span> as
            possible. Could we have our own{" "}
            <span className="font-bold text-primary">auto repair shop</span> or
            oil change shop? A tire shop?
          </p>
          <p>
            Our villagers are not paying rent or utilities, but all the things
            they were spending money on beyond that, are now{" "}
            <span className="font-bold text-primary">revenue streams</span> for
            the village.
          </p>
          <p>
            AND, the animals are better cared for and they are{" "}
            <span className="font-bold text-primary">home ready</span> when a
            potential adopter gets there.
          </p>
          <hr className="border-t-2 border-gray-300 my-8 w-full" />
          <p>
            We could charge a little more for our pets because they are the
            best. We could set it up that the pets all have{" "}
            <span className="font-bold text-primary">vet prepaid medical</span>{" "}
            through our own clinic. We could encourage them to visit our trainer
            and buy our food, join us in{" "}
            <span className="font-bold text-primary">social events</span> and
            eat at our restaurant.
          </p>
          <p>
            I&apos;d like to at least consider the possibility of{" "}
            <span className="font-bold text-primary">3D printing</span> the
            construction of the village. I think this will give us a better
            building(s) and will be less expensive. I&apos;d like to weigh the
            possibility of{" "}
            <span className="font-bold text-primary">solar power</span> to save
            money. Maybe even a{" "}
            <span className="font-bold text-primary">gray water system</span> if
            that&apos;s possible. I think if we explore{" "}
            <span className="font-bold text-primary">technology</span>,
            we&apos;re going to find ways to improve the bottom line.
          </p>
          <p>
            Yes. I&apos;m going to give away the apartments. I think we&apos;ll
            be fine, though.
