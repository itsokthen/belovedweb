        Why this is Important

      <p className="mt-5">
        When I lost Sadie in 2015, and Cali in 2017, I was devastated. Crippled.
        I couldn’t work. I had days that I couldn’t even get out of bed. I lost
        a business after 25 years. I lost the apartment I had lived in for 20
        years. I was homeless for about 2 years (with a little couch-surfing
        when someone would take me in).
      </p>
      <p className="mt-5">
        When we lose a person, we know what to do. We know how to{" "}
        <span className="font-bold text-primary">help each other.</span>
      </p>
      <p className="mt-5">
        We have funerals. We have rituals and ceremonies. We know what to say to
        each other. IT’S LIKE A LANGUAGE that helps us grieve, heal and get
        through the grief. Not just words. But a social{" "}
        <span className="font-bold text-primary">connection</span> and{" "}
        <span className="font-bold text-primary">understanding</span> of the
        devastating emotions a person is experiencing.
      </p>
      <p className="mt-5">
        We do not have such a language for each other when we lose a pet, even
        though for some, like me, the experience is equally devastating.
      </p>{" "}
      <p className="mt-5">
        The silver lining to my journey was that I met hundreds, if not
        thousands, of people who have also lost pets. They felt what I felt.
        They spoke my language. More than anything, that connection was{" "}

        WE NEED A PLACE TO CREATE THIS LANGUAGE.

        I call it a clubhouse, but it looks like a bar and works like a bar.
        We’ll serve drinks and beers and some REALLY GOOD food. If you want to
        come have a beer and cry about your pet, you can do that, and you'll be
        surrounded by people who understand. If you want to come have a beer and
        NOT cry about your pet, you can do that too, and you will still be
        surrounded by people who{" "}
        <span className="font-bold text-primary">understand.</span>
      </p>
      <p className="mt-5">
        {" "}
        But this “bar”, will be much, much more than that. It’s a place to
        develop the <span className="font-bold text-primary">
          tools
        </span> and <span className="font-bold text-primary">resources</span> to
        heal in a friendly, pleasant environment.{" "}
